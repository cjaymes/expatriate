# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to pyscap. It's people like you that make pyscap such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Pyscap is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into pyscap itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions; please keep it to issues with the code.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted.
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in the [Pull Request Checklist](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/wiki/Pull-Request-Checklist)
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### 1. Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/issues)
to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket.
If not, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/issues/new)!

### 2. Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### 3. Get the test suite running

Make sure you're using a recent python (3.5+) and have the requirements from requirements.txt installed.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be able to run the test suite using:

```sh
python -m pytest -v
```

If the tests are failing, you might want to clean your environment:

```sh
sh clean.sh
```

### 4. Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by [searching all
  issues](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/issues?q=).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
  one](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/issues/new).  Be sure to
  include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
  possible, and a **code sample** or an **the failing test case** demonstrating
  the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### 5. Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

### 6. Re-run the tests

Wash and repeat.

### 7. Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's
up to date with pyscap's master branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:cjaymes/pyscap.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 325-add-japanese-translations
```

Finally, go to GitHub and
[make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
:D

### 8. Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code
has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of
[good](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
[resources](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase),
but here's the suggested workflow:

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### 9. Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR should only be merged into master by a maintainer by following the [Pull Request Checklist](https://github.com/cjaymes/pyscap/wiki/Pull-Request-Checklist)

Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are
met.
